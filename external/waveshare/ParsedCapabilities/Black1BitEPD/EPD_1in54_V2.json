  "Notes": "The display primarily supports the black color channel, with no indication of additional colors. The various display functions suggest support for full and partial image updates, with DisplayPartBaseImage indicating a base image setup possibly for partial updates. The presence of partial initialization and display support aligns with these observations.",
