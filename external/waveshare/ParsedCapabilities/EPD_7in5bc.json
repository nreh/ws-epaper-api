  "Notes": "The function EPD_7IN5BC_Display takes two image pointers, suggesting support for black and possibly two additional color channels, assumed to be red and yellow based on naming (ryimage). The function EPD_7IN5BC_DisplayHalfScreen was categorized under Display_Partial due to its descriptive name indicating a partial screen operation. The color channel assumptions are based on typical e-paper color schemes and the function signature.",
