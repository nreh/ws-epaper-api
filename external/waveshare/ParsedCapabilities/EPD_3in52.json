  "Notes": "The header defines black as a basic color channel, and while multiple patterns of black and white are defined (e.g., UP_BLACK_DOWN_WHITE), the primary color channel remains black without other colors. The functions have been categorized based on their apparent functionality with a few falling under 'Display_Misc' due to their names suggesting display-related operations but not fitting the main display pattern. Black and white patterns were considered only as black, following predefined rules.",
